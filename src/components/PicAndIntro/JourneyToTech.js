      <p>
        I’m aware of the opportunities and flexibility that a career in tech can
        offer, not only here in Dublin but also around the world. I couldn’t
        afford to quit my full-time job, therefore a part-time course was my
        option. I started with a five-week Coursera course on HTML, CSS and
        Javascript for Web Developers, which gave me strong fundamentals on
        HTML, CSS and Bootstrap and more importantly,{" "}
        <strong>strengthened my passion for coding </strong>
        and web development. I quickly realised that becoming a Front-End Web
        Developer would suit me best!
      </p>

      <p>
        After extensive research, I decided to do Wild Code School’s remote,
        part-time Front-End Developer Course from April to October 2020, aimed
        to provide technical knowledge and experience for a role as a Front-End
        Web Developer. This includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Building and deploying web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript
          ES6 & React, using concepts such as component lifecycle, state
          management and routing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Responsive design using Flexbox layout model, Bootstrap framework &
          SASS pre-processor.
        </li>
        <li>
          Version control using Git and GitHub in projects, involving working in
          a group project. I created a workflow to help me and my team, which I
          summarized in this blog post
        </li>
        <li>
          Application of agile methodology, including stand-up meetings, 2-week
          sprints for projects, and end-of-sprint 5-minute demos of the
          completed work.
        </li>
        <li>
          Project planning including creating wireframes with user experience in
          mind and issue tracking using Jira and Trello to track the user
          stories, product backlogs, sprint backlogs & progress of tasks during
          the sprint.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I’m determined to develop further and eventually become a ‘T-Shaped’
        developer, with in-depth focus in front-end but have basic knowledge of
        back-end. Therefore, I have immersed myself in learning some back-end by
        creating a CRUD service using AWS Lambda functions and expose them as
        RESTful APIs using Amazon API Gateway, which I then used as part of my
        budget tracker app.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am keen to further develop my skills as a Software Developer,
        especially in the back-end, which led me to start Code Institute's
        part-time Diploma in Full Stack Software Development in October 2020. I
        will be further enhancing my front-end skills and upskilling my back-end
        knowledge by learning Python and Django.
      </p>

        <strong>
          I am currently looking for Junior Software Developer opportunities,
          with focus in Front-End.
